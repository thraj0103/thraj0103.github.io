                I’m currently pursuing my Master’s in Robotics at
                <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.northeastern.edu/" target="_blank"
                    style="color: #66FCF1; text-decoration: underline;">Northeastern University</a>,
                where I spend most of my time making machines a little smarter. Before that, I studied Electrical
                Engineering at
                <a class="underline-link" href="https://nitrkl.ac.in/" target="_blank"
                    style="color: #66FCF1; text-decoration: underline;">NIT Rourkela</a>,
                where my fascination with building systems that go beyond theory really began.

            <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
                My work lives at the intersection of perception, classical & learning-based controls, and planning. I’ve
                explored projects spanning reinforcement learning pipelines, non linear controls, path planning, 3D
                perception
                and mathematical optimization, each aimed at helping robots perceive their world and act with purpose.
                What excites me most is that “aha”
                moment when theory clicks into something functional, when an algorithm finally runs in real time, or a
                robot starts
                behaving the way it should.

                <strong>When I’m not working with robots</strong>, I’m usually exploring places, watching Formula 1, or
                chasing
                the next “what if?” question that sparks my curiosity.
