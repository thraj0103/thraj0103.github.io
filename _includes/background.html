      I’m a robotics engineer focused on <strong>perception, learning-based control, and planning</strong>. I like taking algorithms out of papers and into
      <strong>working systems</strong>—from simulation to hardware—using Python/C++, ROS 2, and modern ML tools.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Recent work includes: optimizing fiber-optic scanning for endoscopy (simulation → ILP with Gurobi → hardware-in-the-loop RL), a ROS 2 human-following
      pipeline (YOLOv8 + DeepSORT + LiDAR–camera fusion with SMC control), beacon-aided multi-sensor SLAM in GNSS-denied settings, and D* Lite path planning
      for dynamic obstacles. I care about <strong>robustness, testability,</strong> and clean interfaces.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      I’m currently looking for internships where I can contribute to <strong>vision, RL, planning/SLAM,</strong> and ROS-based robotics software.

      As a software engineer, I enjoy bridging the gap between engineering and design &mdash; combining my technical knowledge
      with my keen eye for design to create a beautiful product. My goal is to always build applications that are scalable
      and efficient under the hood while providing engaging, pixel-perfect user experiences.

      or crossing off another item on my bucket list.
