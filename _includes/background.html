      I’m currently pursuing my Master’s in Robotics at
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.northeastern.edu/" target="_blank">Northeastern University</a>,
      where I spend most of my time making robots a little smarter. Before that, I studied Electrical Engineering at
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://nitrkl.ac.in/" target="_blank">NIT Rourkela</a>,
      where my fascination with building systems that go beyond theory really began.

      My work lives at the intersection of perception, learning-based control, and planning. I’ve explored projects spanning reinforcement learning pipelines, 
      SLAM, path planning, control and optimization, each aimed at helping robots perceive their world and act with purpose. What excites me most is that “aha” moment when 
      theory clicks into something functional, when an algorithm finally runs in real time, or a robot starts behaving the way it should.

      <strong>When I’m not working with robots</strong>, I’m usually outdoors, watching Formula 1, or chasing the next “what if?” question that sparks my curiosity.

      As a software engineer, I enjoy bridging the gap between engineering and design &mdash; combining my technical knowledge
      with my keen eye for design to create a beautiful product. My goal is to always build applications that are scalable
      and efficient under the hood while providing engaging, pixel-perfect user experiences.

      or crossing off another item on my bucket list.
