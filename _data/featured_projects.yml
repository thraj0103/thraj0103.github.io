- title: Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance with D* Lite (ROS 2 Nav2)
  url: /projects/dstar-lite.html
  image: /img/featured/dstar-lite/thumb.jpg
  description: Built a custom Nav2 planner plugin implementing D* Lite for real-time replanning. Integrated a dynamic costmap, an efficient cell-based priority queue, and smoothing for safe paths around sudden, occluded, and close-range obstacles.
