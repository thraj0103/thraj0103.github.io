- title: Beacon-Based Localization for Multi-Sensor Fusion SLAM
  url: /projects/beacon-slam.html
  image: /img/featured/beacon-slam/thumb.jpg
  description: Added beacon-based global pose correction to an RTAB-Map SLAM stack in ROS 2; fused odometry and beacon ranges with a particle filter to reduce drift in GNSS-denied, feature-sparse spaces.

- title: Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance with D* Lite (ROS 2 Nav2)
  url: /projects/dstar-lite.html
  image: /img/featured/dstar-lite/thumb.jpg
  description: Built a custom Nav2 planner plugin implementing D* Lite for real-time replanning. Integrated a dynamic costmap, an efficient cell-based priority queue, and smoothing for safe paths around sudden, occluded, and close-range obstacles.
