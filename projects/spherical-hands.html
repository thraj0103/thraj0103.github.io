## MISSION_OBJECTIVE

<div class="content-block">
  <p><strong>TARGET:</strong> Reproduce and analyze the Spherical Hands underactuated grasping mechanism from
    Ma et al. (2016) — a robotic hand where all joint axes intersect at a single remote center point, enabling
    <em>size-invariant grasping</em> without active control of individual finger forces.
  </p>

  <p><strong>APPROACH:</strong> Full SolidWorks CAD model with 45-degree angular offsets and 0.72 radian base tilt,
    Grübler mobility analysis, forward kinematics via Screw Theory and Product of Exponentials, and dynamic
    Motion Study simulation with passive spring compliance to validate adaptive underactuated grasping.</p>

## SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE

### [ MECHANISM DESIGN ]

<ul class="feature-list">
  <li><strong>Fingers:</strong> Two curved fingers + one straight thumb. Each curved finger has two revolute joints with
    axes intentionally offset at 45° so both intersect at remote center point $N$ above the palm.</li>
  <li><strong>Underactuation:</strong> 3 active proximal joints (motors) drive 6 joints total via passive distal joints
    with torsional springs — 2:1 underactuation ratio.</li>
  <li><strong>Thumb:</strong> Conventional planar geometry with a passive pivot base adding one extra passive DOF for
    lateral grasp adaptability without active control.</li>
  <li><strong>Spring Compliance:</strong> Distal joints have $k = 20\;\text{N·mm/deg} \approx 1.15\;\text{N·m/rad}$,
    damping $c = 0.001\;\text{N·mm/(deg/s)}$.</li>
</ul>

### [ MOBILITY ANALYSIS (GRÜBLER) ]

<div class="content-block">
  <p>Two configurations were analyzed using the spatial Grübler formula $M = 6(n-1-j) + \sum f_i$:</p>
</div>

<ul class="feature-list">
  <li><strong>Open Hand:</strong> $M = 6$ — full spatial mobility for finger positioning.</li>
  <li><strong>Grasped Object:</strong> $M = 3$ — constrained by object contact, enabling stable in-hand manipulation.
  </li>
</ul>

## EXECUTION_LOG

### 1. Forward Kinematics — Screw Theory & Product of Exponentials

<p>Each curved finger's proximal and distal joints are modeled as screw axes passing through the remote center point
  $N$. The screw axis for joint $i$ with unit direction $\omega_i$ is:</p>

<div class="math-block">
  $$\mathcal{S}_i = \begin{bmatrix} \omega_i \\ -\omega_i \times r_N \end{bmatrix}$$
</div>

<p>The 45-degree angular offsets ensure both axes satisfy the intersection condition
  $\omega \cdot (N - q) = 0$. The full fingertip transform uses the Product of Exponentials:</p>

<div class="math-block">
  $$T(\theta_1, \theta_2) = e^{[\mathcal{S}_1]\theta_1}\,e^{[\mathcal{S}_2]\theta_2}\,M$$
</div>

<p>where matrix exponentials follow Rodrigues' formula:</p>

<div class="math-block">
  $$e^{[\omega]\theta} = I + \sin\theta\,[\omega] + (1-\cos\theta)\,[\omega]^2$$
</div>

### 2. Motion Study — Sinusoidal Motor Trajectories

<p>Three proximal motors follow sinusoidal trajectories with 120° phase offsets, producing a sequential
  wave-like closing pattern that distributes contact timing across the three fingers:</p>

  </div>
  <pre class="code-window__content"><code>% Sinusoidal motor trajectories with 120-deg phase spacing
f  = 0.5;   % Hz
A  = 20;    % deg amplitude
t0 = 40;    % deg initial angle

theta_F1(t)    = t0 + A * sin(2*pi*f*t +   0);   % phi_1 = 0
theta_F2(t)    = t0 + A * sin(2*pi*f*t + 120);   % phi_2 = 120 deg
theta_thumb(t) = t0 + A * sin(2*pi*f*t + 240);   % phi_3 = 240 deg

% Distal spring dynamics (passive compliance)
tau_spring = -k*(theta - theta0) - c*(d_theta/dt);
% k = 1.15 N.m/rad, c = 0.001 N.mm/(deg/s)</code></pre>

  </div>
</div>

<div class="content-block">
  <p>The Motion Study simulation successfully demonstrated stable grasping of an equilateral triangular prism
    (inscribing radius $r = 25\;\text{mm}$, depth $d = 10\;\text{mm}$). The passive distal springs automatically
    adapted to the object geometry, with spring deflections varying per-finger based on contact location and force
    distribution. The 120° phase spacing produced sequential finger engagement, allowing progressive spring
    adaptation before full three-point contact was established.</p>

  <p>This confirms the geometric design principle: all joint axes intersecting at $N$ creates a spherical workspace
    constraint that decouples finger motion from object geometry — the mechanism grasps stably regardless of where
    along the spherical surface contact occurs.</p>

## ANOMALY_REPORT

<div class="alert-box alert-danger">
  <h4>CHALLENGE: 45-Degree Offset Geometry Complexity</h4>

  <p><strong>ISSUE:</strong> The 45-degree angular offsets required for joint axis intersection at the remote center
    point $N$ create complex non-planar spatial geometry. Maintaining precise angular relationships throughout the
    SolidWorks assembly — especially at mating surfaces between proximal links and curved finger geometry — required
    careful constraint management to avoid over-constrained or degenerate configurations.</p>

  <p><strong>KEY TRADE-OFF:</strong> The spring constant $k = 1.15\;\text{N·m/rad}$ balances grasp force capability
    against passive adaptation compliance. Too stiff and the distal joints cannot adapt to object geometry; too
    compliant and grasp stability is lost under load.</p>

  <p><strong>VALIDATION GAP:</strong> The Ma et al. reference work validated size-invariant grasping across
    38–58 mm object sizes. This implementation demonstrated grasping for a single 25 mm test object. Testing
    across a range of object sizes remains as future work to fully verify the size-invariance property.</p>
